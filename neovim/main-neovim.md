# Neovim REPO

I started my Neovim journey last week and I think it's being a wonderful switch from VS Code.
I was encouraged from friends to take this path and I'm getting into it.
I'm currently using LazyVim for some lazy configurations but the idea is in the future to create my own configs for neovim.
