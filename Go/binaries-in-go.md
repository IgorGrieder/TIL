# Go Binaries

We can build our entire application into a binary file and give it to someone to
run our application in a very, very easy way. In the `go.mod` file we can
determine the OS the binary will need to be compiled to. This makes Go super
portable to any OS.

## How to run

```terminal
go build name-you-want
just type the binary name ./name-you-gave
```
